\subsection{Getting Started}
\ds is invoked as a python script from a terminal window.
\ds will immediately search the environment for all available serial ports.
Failure to find any serial ports will cause \ds to exit.
If only one serial port is available this will be connected to automatically.
When more than one serial port is found a choice will presented.
User choices persist between program executions.

When a serial port is selected a baud rate must be chosen.
Any value can be taken  but this may be limited by chosen hardware.
